'''
So backpack would be a self organizing inventory class that 
would seperate different items into their respected categories
For this to work we use a dictionary seperated by item type
'''
class Backpack:
    def __init__(self, max_items, max_weight):
        self.max_items = max_items
        self.max_weight = max_weight
        
    def items:
        return self.__items
