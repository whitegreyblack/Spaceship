race_human="""
The youngest race on the continent of Auriel, humans were the last to arrive from across the Endless Water and, yet
with their ingenuity, versatility, and endurance, they have thrived and become a dominant force throughout the land. 
The Empire of Rodash and the Free States are the fruits of their labor. Through quick learning they have become the 
masters of the element of LIGHTNING.

race_dwarf="""
A hardy race, dwarves are most famous for their impenetrable fortresses and mass earthly wealth. Their vast fortune
allows their people to pursue trades and crafts such as blacksmithing, jewelry, and weaponforging, which would not
be possible otherwise. The dwarven race are masters of the EARTH element and use this to their advantage. Dwarves
met outside their underground castles are fine traders and merchants as well as formidable in battle. They start
with either an axe or a pick, both deadly in the hands of a dwarf.

race_elven="""
The long-lived, mysterious race of elves reside deep within the forests of Auriel. Though they seem frail at first 
to those who have yet met an elf, their appearances betray them as they have a stronger fortitude than meets the
untrained eye. Elves boast the strongest attunment to the element WATER which they use to nurture the trees and living
creatures within the forests they dwell in.

race_ishtahari="""
Among all the races that live across Auriel, the Ishtahari are the oldest. Yet having lived on the continent hundreds
of years before any of the other races, they are now as rare to meet as their magic is to learn. They are the only 
race to master two elements of the seven, LIGHT and VOID
