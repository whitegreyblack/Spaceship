The largest difference between World and City map tiles is that you can
enter any tile in a World map that is not water/mountain. Which makes 
more than 75% of the playable map enterable. Compared to city map tiles
which only allow one to five enterable locations if any. This leads to a
consideration of what kind of data structure should be used when storing
levels underneath each map.

For world maps: Use a hashmap(x, y) -> coordinate structure
	we create an empty dictionary. This dictionary stores references to
	locations reached by the player. We initialize it as empty at runtime
	since doing so reduces the amount of memory needed and the dictionary
	will build itself dynamically once the player reaches more and more 
	locations around the map.

For city maps: Use a doubly linked list structure
	we create an none variable [sublevel] which will hold a single reference
	to a location. This leads to a user's ability to iterate through top and
	sub levels by following the parent/child references in each map
